## Project Overview
I put this project together to create an interactive dashboard using Power BI. My goal was to visualize and analyze Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) projects worldwide. It was fascinating to take raw data and turn it into something useful and easy to understand for anyone curious about global climate and energy initiatives.

The dashboard lets you explore the state of the CCS industry, showing project locations, their current status, and the technologies they use.

## Features
The dashboard is bulit to make data exploration simple and intuitive. You'll find a variety of visuals:
* **A World Map**: The core dashboard, showing where every project is located across the globe.
* **Project Status**: A quick-look bar chart summarizing the number of projects that are Active, Terminated, on Hold, and more.
* **Technologies Used**: A breakdown of different carbon capture processes, like Post-Combustion and Pre-Combustion.
* **Flow of Projects**: A detailed chart that traces projects from their continents to their status and purpose, helping to tell more-indepth story.
* **Project Details**: Simple charts that show whether projects are national or international abd what stage of development they are in.

## Technologies & Skills Used
* Power BI Desktop: The main tool I used for building the dashboard.
* Power Query: I used this to clean and transform the raw data, including removing any irrelevant information to make sure everything was accurate.
* Geospatial visualization: A big focus for me was visualizing the data on the map. Leveraged Power BI's integration with ESRI, to create a professional and detailed map that shows the geographic spread of the projects and how they relate to each other globally.
* Data Analysis: I enjoyed digging into the data to find interesting trends and then structuring the dashboard to make that story clear to anyone who looks at it.

## A story from the Data
Beyond just the numbers, this dashboard helped me uncover some interesting things about carbon capture around the world:
1. **Geographic Focus:** The data clearly shows that the majority of the carbon capture efforts are concentrated in North America andd Europe> This highlights where the most significant investment and development are currently taking place.
2. **The "On Hold" Challenge:** While the industry looks busy and active, a good number of projects are on hold. The chart for North America and Europe also shows this clearly, which suggests some real-world problems are stopping projects from getting finished.
3. **Technology & Location:** The dashboard also let me see how different capture technologies are spread out across the map. This helped me find out which regions are suing certain carbon management methods more than others.
4. **The International Scope (Working Together):** A look at the project's scope shows that most of them are international, not just national. This highlights that working together across border is a key part of these projects, which makes sense for global challenge like climate change.


## Data Source
The data for this dashboard comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/konradb/carbon-capture-and-storage). You can find the raw data files in the [Data Folder](Data) in this repo.

## How to check it out
Since i can't host this dashboard live, you can  still get a full sense of the project by:
1. **Viewing the Screenshot & PDF**: Theres a high-res image and a pdf of the final dashboard in the /Images folder.
2. **Opening Project File**: If you have Power BI Desktop, you can download the .pbix file from the [Dashboard Folder](Dashboard) with the full/unfiltered dashboard.
