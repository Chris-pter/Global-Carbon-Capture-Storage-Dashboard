# Global-Carbon-Capture-Storage-Dashboard

###Project Overview
I put this project together to create an interactive dashboard using Power BI. <y goal was to visualize and analyze carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects worldwide. It was fascinating to take raw data and turn it into something useful and easy to understand for anyone curious about global climate and energy initiatives.

The dashboard lets you explore the state of the CCS industry, showing project locations, their current status, and the technologies they use.

###Features
The dashboard is bulit to make data exploration simple and intuitive. You'll find a variety of visuals:
#A World Map: The core dashboard, showing where every project is located across the globe.
#Project Status: A quick-look bar chart summarizing the number of projects that are Active, Terminated, on Hold, and more.
#Technologies Used: A breakdown of different carbon capture processes, like Post-Combustion and Pre-Combustion.
#Flow of Projects: A detailed chart that traces projects from their continents to their status and purpose, helping to tell more-indepth story.
#Project Details: Simple charts that show whether projects are national or international abd what stage of development they are in.

###Technologies & Skills Used
#Power BI Desktop: The main tool I used for building the dashboard.
#Power Query: I sude this to clean and transform the raw data, including removing any irrelevant information to make sure everything was accurate.
#Geospatial visualization:A big focus for me was visualizing the data on the map. Leveraged Power BI's integration with ESRI, to create a professional and detailed map that shows the geographic spread of the projects and how they relate to each other globally.
#Data Analysis: I enjoyed digging into the data to find interesting trends and then structuring the dashboard to make that story clear to anyone who looks at it.

###Data Source
The data for this dashboard comes from Kaggle. You can find the raw data files in the /Data folder in this repo.
